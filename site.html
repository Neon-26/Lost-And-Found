        <p>Hi there! Welcome to our Lost and Found System â€” your helpful tool for finding and reporting lost items within Pateros 
            Technological College. We understand how stressful it can be to misplace something important, so this system makes 
            it easier for you to report and track your belongings. Once an item is reported, the Student Council will be notified 
            to verify and ensure everything is handled securely. With this, you can easily stay updated and recover your lost 
            items faster, all within a safe and organized campus system made just for students like you.
